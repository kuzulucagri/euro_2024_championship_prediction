Using Python, Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pickle, Scipy and Streamlit, I simulated the tournament: from group stages to the final match. Employed Poisson distribution for match predictions and showcased standings and fixtures dynamically.

In this project, I performed Web Scrapping, Data Cleansing, Numeric Calculation, Analysis and Prediction to find who may be the champion this year in the tournament.
